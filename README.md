## Installing additional libraries
To use this you will need to install some additional libraries, this is done through Tools > Manage Libraries, you will need to install:
- "TinyGPS" by Mikal Hart
- "Time" by Michael Margolis. 

Some libraries wont show up in the manager, to solve this try searching the developer name instead.
